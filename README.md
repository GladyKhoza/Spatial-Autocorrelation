# Spatial-Autocorrelation
This was my MSc Statistical Analysis and Research Project
This project was on spatial autocorrelation. I was checking the correlation between drug abuse and locations in Gauteng and found that the City of Ekurhuleni follwed by City of Johannesburg had the highest number of drug abusers. This showed that there was a correlation between where a person stays and their use of drugs. The environment and places found within the Cities of Ekurhuleni and Johannesburg enable the high number of drug abuse
